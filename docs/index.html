                    If the label says your garment is made of 100% cotton, linen, silk, wool, or a blend of any of these, it is probably one of your favorite pieces of clothing, right? The reason for this is because it is made of natural fibers. You may already know this because who doesn't love clothing that feels good?
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-2xl pb-10">What about 50/50, 70/30 or 80/20?</h2>
                <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                    For your pocket, it meant that you bought that item for much less than other garments you have made of 100% natural fiber. For you, it meant the best way to own that clothing you liked so much. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-2xl pb-10">So, what exactly is the problem with polyester?</h2>
                <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                    Sometimes brands don't tell us the whole story. We want you to know it all! 
                </p>
                <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                    Polyester is a kind of plastic. Its technical name is polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Since it's a synthetic fiber, it doesn't come from a plant like cotton. Polyester is made from petroleum-based chemicals
                </p>
                <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                    Since polyester is plastic, it is considered non-biodegradable. Polyester never disappears; it just gets smaller and smaller.
                </p>
                <h2 class="text-2xl pb-10">What's behind recycled polyester?</h2>
                <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                    Many brands have made statements about their fabrics and how they are switching to climate-friendly materials. Even though this sounds good (it is good to move away from virgin polyester!) for materials to be climate friendly, they should not create a new problem for our environment, right?

                <span class="font-bold">Stage 1.</span> Our garment begins far from thread—in fact, it's currently enjoying a scorching day on the beach, shoved inside an ice chest. That's right: our garment is a water bottle, for now.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                <span class="font-bold">Stage 2.</span> After a long day of hydrating, the water bottle is rehomed from the ice chest to the recycling bin.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5 text-black">
                <span class="font-bold">Stage 3.</span> The water bottle is then sanitized, shredded into small fragments, and melted down, the plastic is re-spun into recycled polyester fibers. These fibers are valued by companies for being cheap to produce, durable, and high-performance.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                <span class="font-bold">Stage 4.</span> Once re-spun and spooled into a usable yarn, our tube top finally takes shape and finds its place on a clothing rack.

            <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                <span class="font-bold">Stage 5.</span> Fast forward a few weeks, and our garment has found a home in a very cozy closet. With every washing cycle the tube top takes, it releases a slew of microplastics into the water.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                <span class="font-bold">Stage 6.</span> After being worn for a couple years, our garment begins to show some wear, but because it is still “wearable,” it is donated rather than trashed. Once back on the racks, the tube top is only given passing glances, as it has become a second rate, “untrendy” item.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                <span class="font-bold">Stage 7.</span> Once its time in the thrift store has come to an end, the tube top ends up back in the bin—however, unlike its original water bottle form, its recycled polyester form cannot be recycled again.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                <span class="font-bold">Stage 8.</span> The traits that once made our garment ideal, like its durability, are now a detriment. Once in the landfill, our tube top will keep its form for decades, maybe even centuries, as it is not a biodegradable product.

                You can dispose of recycled polyester (rPET) clothes in a few ways.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                Donating to thrift stores is the first choice of many when faced with discarding unwanted, lightly used clothing.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                But what about clothes that are beyond wearing? You can repurpose old t-shirts by cutting them up and using them as rags!
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5 text-black text-lg">
                Finally, there are businesses that seek out old clothing items, turning them from flop to hot—turning unwearables into home insulation!

                    While no one can change the fashion industry on their own, everyone can "vote with their dollar" by checking those labels and buying fewer clothes made out of polyester.
